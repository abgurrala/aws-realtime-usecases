# Copy N Objects From Bucket

## Scenario
Your client has 2000+ objects in a certain S3 bucket and want to copy them over to another location. The files to be copied have _predictable names_ with numerical suffixes. 

For example, 
The first object is named `location[yyyy_mm_xxx1].csv.gz`. 
Object number twenty-one will be named, `location[yyyy_mm_xx21].csv.gz`. 

Can you propose a quick and automated solution to copy the files? If possible can make your solution re-usable?
